# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In general, only the latest version is actively supported with
critical bug fixed and security issues.

| Version | Supported          |

| 2.0     | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0     | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be reported to my personal email address
(you can check it from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/pleonex)).

All the security issues will be analyzed and a reply will be given
in two working days. Once the issue is accepted it will be fixed in
the current development branch and for the latest version. A new
version would be released.
